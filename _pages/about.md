Hello, kind stranger! 

Thank you for visiting my site, and welcome!

My name is Luis Itza Vazquez-Salazar. I am a Swiss National Science Foundation Postdoctoral fellow in Physics (Although I am a chemist) in the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php?lang=e) at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en) with [Prof. Dr. Tristan Bereau](https://tristanbereau.com/).

My research is quite varied. I am interested in the influence of training data on the performance of machine learning models in chemistry, uncertainty quantification in atomistic machine learning models, characterization of reactive processes, automatic construction of machine learning potential energy surfaces, backmapping between different molecular resolutions, use of generative models in Chemistry, exploration of chemical space, etc.

Previously, I finished my PhD in Chemistry at the [University of Basel](https://www.unibas.ch/en.html) in the group of [Prof. Dr. Markus Meuwly](https://quantitative-md-lab.org/) working on the interface of molecular simulations and machine learning techniques. Before Switzerland, I did a [TCCM](https://www.emtccm.org/) master at the [Universty of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) on the [Theoretical Chemistry Group](https://www.rug.nl/research/zernike/theoretical-chemistry/faraji-group/). My master thesis was in combination with the [Molecular Dynamics Group](https://www.rug.nl/research/molecular-dynamics/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Siewert-Jan Marrink](https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.j.marrink/) 
and [Dr. Paulo Telles de Souza](https://mmsb.cnrs.fr/en/u/telles-de-souza-paulo/) on the development of new coarse grain models for imidazolium-based ionic liquids with the [MARTINI](http://cgmartini.nl/) force field.
