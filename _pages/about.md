Hello kind stranger! 

Thank you for visiting my site and welcome!

My name is Luis Itza Vazquez-Salazar. I am a PhD student at the [University of Basel](https://www.unibas.ch/en.html) on the laboratory of [Prof.Dr.Markus Meuwly](https://quantitative-md-lab.org/). 

My research is oriented to the development of machine learning techniques to the study of potential energy surfaces using active learning approaches. I am also interested on the development of solvation models for the study of
reactive proceses. Additionally, I am interested on the development of machine learning techniques for the parametrization of coarse grain force fields.

Previously, I did a [TCCM](https://www.emtccm.org/) master at the [Universty of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) on the [Theoretical Chemistry Group](https://www.rug.nl/research/zernike/theoretical-chemistry/faraji-group/).
My master thesis was in combination with the [Molecular Dynamics Group](https://www.rug.nl/research/molecular-dynamics/) under the supervision of [Prof.Dr. Siewert-Jan Marrink](https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.j.marrink/) 
and [Dr. Paulo Telles de Souza](https://mmsb.cnrs.fr/en/u/telles-de-souza-paulo/) 
on the development of new coarse grain models for imidazolium-based ionic liquids with the [MARTINI](http://cgmartini.nl/) force field.
